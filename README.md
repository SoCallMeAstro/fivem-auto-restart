# fivem-auto-restart

This is a simple extention for easier development with FiveM. I had inspiration to make this after using FxDK (FiveM's Development Kit), because it has a feature to automatically restart the resource after changes.

## Requirements

To use this extention, all you need to do is setup a rcon password in your servers server.cfg file like so:

`rcon_password "whateverpassword"`

The password doesn't really matter, you can put whatever you would like in there

After you add the password, and restart you server you can then, Ctrl + Shift + P to open the command pallet, and select "Connect to FiveM Server", enter whatever password you have in your server.cfg.

**Enjoy!**
